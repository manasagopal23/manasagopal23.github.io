excerpt: "<img src='/images/LogAmount_TLAvsTLB.png' height='1000' width='550' align='right'>We document three facts about nonbank lending in the syndicated loan market. First, nonbank lending is more than twice as cyclical as bank lending. Second, declines in nonbank lending explain most of the declines in syndicated lending during the Great Recession and COVID-19 crisis. Third, cyclicality in nonbank lending is matched by cyclicality in nonbank funding flows. The higher nonbank cyclicality is not explained by either the health or monitoring ability of banks, nor by bank-borrower relationships. Instead, it appears to be driven by nonbank funding instability. We highlight frictions in CLOs and mutual funds that contribute to this instability. "

</br>We show that cyclicality in the syndicated lending market is driven by nonbank lenders. Lending by nonbanks in the syndicated lending market is nearly three times as cyclical as lending by banks, after controlling for loan and borrower characteristics. This cyclicality is explained by nonbanksâ€™ access to financing. In busts, lack of CLO issuances and outflows from mutual funds lead to a drop in primary market originations of syndicated loans; and inflows to nonbanks during booms spur new loan originations. The higher cyclicality is not explained (nor offset) by bank behavior:	banks cut originations when nonbank lenders exit the market, irrespective of their characteristics. Our paper brings forth an important reason for the decline in loan originations during both the Great Recession and COVID-19 crisis and highlights that interventions for credit market recovery may require support for nonbank lenders.
