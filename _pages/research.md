  <li> The Rise of Finance Companies in U.S. Small Business Lending (<em>Draft Coming Soon</em>)<br>
   Coauthors: Philipp Schnabl<br>
   Using novel data on all secured, non-real estate U.S. business loans from 2006 to 2016, we find that finance companies substituted for   decrease in bank lending to small businesses after 2010. We control for credit demand by examining lending by banks and finance     companies to the same firm, by comparing firms pledging the same collateral, and by comparing firms within the same narrow industry.
