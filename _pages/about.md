I am a PhD candidate in Finance at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, New York University. My research interests lie in financial intermediation, and corporate finance. I study business lending in the U.S. with a special focus on the role of nonbanks in small business lending. 

I am on the Job Market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA Meetings in San Diego in January,2020
