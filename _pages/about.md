I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Scheller College of Business, Georgia Tech. My research interests lie in financial intermediation and corporate finance. I study business lending in the U.S. with a special focus on the role of nonbanks in small business lending. My research has been published in the Review of Financial Studies and Management Science. 

I received my Ph.D. in Finance from the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, New York University in May 2020.
