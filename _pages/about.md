I am a PhD candidate in Finance at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, New York University. My research interests lie in financial intermediation and corporate finance. I study business lending in the U.S. with a special focus on the role of nonbanks in small business lending. 

I will be joining the faculty at the Scheller College of Business, Georgia Tech as an Assistant Professor in Finance in Fall 2020.
