excerpt: "Using real estate investment trusts (REITs) that invest in commercial real estate (CRE) as a leading example, we study the implications of bank credit lines to nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs). While small and mid-size banks hold an economically significant direct exposure in CRE term loans, a significant part of the CRE exposure of large banks is indirect via credit-line provision to REITs. Utilization of credit lines by REITs tends to be substantially higher on average than non-financial corporates and other NBFIs, and reflects the performance of underlying real estate, in normal times and especially during stress. In turn, large banks suffer drawdowns and equity corrections in stress times from extending credit lines to REITs. Ignoring this credit line channel understates the exposure of large banks to CRE risks. We propose a methodology to incorporate this exposure in bank capital stress tests."
