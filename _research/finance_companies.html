title: "The Rise of Finance Companies in U.S. Small Business Lending"
collection: research

excerpt: "Using novel data on all secured, non-real estate U.S. business loans from 2006 to
2016, we find that banks reduced their lending by 27% after the 2008 financial crisis.
Alternative lenders, primarily finance companies, started to substitute for bank lending
in 2010. By 2016, finance companies had grown to originate 57% of all new loans. In
the cross-section, we find that counties with a higher bank market share in 2006 had
a larger drop in total lending after 2008 but the drop was eventually offset by finance
companies. We control for credit demand by examining lending by banks and fiance
companies to the same firm, by comparing firms pledging the same collateral, and
by comparing firms within the same narrow industry. Consistent with substitution of
banks with finance companies, we find no long-term real effects on employment, new
business creation, and business expansion by 2016. Our results suggest that finance
companies are a major supplier of credit to U.S. firms and played an important role in
the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.<br/><img src='/images/Figure1_agg_plot.png' width="50%" height="50%">"
