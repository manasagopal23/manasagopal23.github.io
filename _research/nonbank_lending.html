title: "The Role of Nonbanks in Lending During the Great Recession"
coauthor: German Gutierrez 
collection: research
permalink: /research/nonbank_lending/
excerpt: "We study how the presence of institutional lenders in the syndicated lending market increases 
the cyclicality of credit supply. We develop a simple model of the syndicated lending market, where banks make, 
securitize, distribute, and trade loans in markets with varying nonbank dependence. 
Faced with increased demand from institutions in good times, banks with higher nonbank 
dependence increase originations to capture fees. When demand falls, these banks find themselves 
financially constrained and with limited syndication partners. They cut lending even in markets 
with low dependence on nonbanks, i.e., there is a spillover across markets. By contrast, banks with 
limited nonbank dependence maintain originations through the cycle, and increase their lead shares at the
height of the crisis. We test these predictions in the data, and find strong support for the model. 
Banks with higher nonbank dependence cut originations more during the crisis. Using a variety of 
strategies, we establish that this relationship is causal and independent of bank health. "
