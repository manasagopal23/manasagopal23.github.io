</br>We study the implications of mark-to-market accounting for originations in the syndicated lending market. Banks with higher MTM dependence increase originations to capture fees and make capital gains during booms. When secondary market prices fall sufficiently below par, as observed in the Great Recession and late 2015, new originations as well as existing loans face MTM losses. High MTM banks respond by cutting originations even in markets with low dependence on MTM, i.e., there is a spillover across markets. By contrast, banks with limited MTM dependence maintain originations through the cycle, and increase their lead shares at the height of the crisis. We establish that this relationship is causal and independent of bank health.</br>
