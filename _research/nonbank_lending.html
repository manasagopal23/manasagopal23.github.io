title: "The Role of Nonbanks in Lending During the Great Recession"
authors: Manasa Gopal, German Gutierrez 
collection: research
permalink: /research/nonbank_lending/
excerpt: "We document the role of nonbanks in exacerbating the credit crunch during the
Great Recession, focusing on the syndicated lending market. Nonbanks participated
in nearly 40% of syndicates before the crisis, and essentially exited the market during
the crisis. Traditional banks did not fill the gap. Instead, banks cut originations further
due to an inability to syndicate new loans. Banks in the highest quartile of nonbank
dependence reduced originations by 89% compared to only 34% for the lowest quartile.
Controlling for nonbank dependence, measures of bank health are no longer
significant predictors of declines in originations. Why, then, would some banks partner
with nonbanks while others don’t? We build and test a simple empirical matching
model for the market structure. Given a desire to maintain lending through the cycle,
safe banks partner with each other, while riskier banks partner with nonbanks."
