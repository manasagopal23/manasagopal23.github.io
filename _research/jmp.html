title: How Collateral Affects Small Business Lending: The Role of Lender Specialization (Job Market Paper)
collection: research
permalink: /research/jmp/
excerpt: Lenders contact credit in a downturn by specializing in collateral. Borrowers with ex-ante matches to lenders with low specialization in their collateral receive fewer loans in the aftermath of financial crisis. This has implications for firm employment. I explore the channels driving lender specialization.

I study the role of lender specialization in collateral on the distribution of credit to borrowers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. I construct a novel data on loan-level, secured small business lending in the U.S., linked to the U.S. Census of Establishments. I use text analysis to identify the level of matching between borrowers and lenders by comparing the borrower's collateral to the collateral specialization of the lender. I show that, during a credit supply shock, lenders ration credit by specializing in collateral. Firms that are weakly matched to their lenders on collateral receive fewer loans in a downturn.  I show that this effect holds within-firms, and within-lenders. I identify the channel affecting lender behavior to be driven by the lender's informational advantage in collateral. I further show that firms with generalized collateral find it easier to substitute credit from new lenders, directly affecting employment outcomes. This paper documents a novel channel for the allocation of credit to borrowers in a downturn.
