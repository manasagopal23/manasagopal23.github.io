title: "How Collateral Affects Small Business Lending: The Role of Lender Specialization (Job Market Paper)"
collection: research
permalink: /research/jmp/
excerpt: Lenders contact credit in a downturn by specializing in collateral. Borrowers with ex-ante matches to lenders with low specialization in their collateral receive fewer loans in the aftermath of financial crisis. This has implications for firm employment. I explore the channels driving lender specialization.

<br>I study the role of collateral on the distribution of credit to small business borrowers in a crisis. I construct a novel dataset on loan-level, secured small business lending in the U.S. and link it to the U.S. Census of Establishments. Using textual analysis, I quantify the level of matching between borrowers and lenders by comparing the borrower's collateral to the collateral specialization of the lender. I show that, after the start of the 2008 financial crisis, lenders rationed credit by increasing their specialization in collateral. Borrowing firms that were weakly matched to their lenders on collateral received fewer loans.  I show that this effect holds within-firms, and within-lenders. I identify the channel affecting lender behavior and show that it is driven by the lender's informational advantage in the collateral that is posted. I further show that firms with collateral that is more generally accepted found it easier to obtain credit from new lenders, directly affecting small business employment outcomes. In sum, this paper documents a new channel for the allocation of credit to small business borrowers over a business cycle.</br>
