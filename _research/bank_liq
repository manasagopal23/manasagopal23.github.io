excerpt: "<img src='/images/LogAmount_TLAvsTLB.png' height='1000' width='550' align='right'>We document that banks appear reluctant to provide contingent liquidity in the form of credit lines to corporations that are reliant on non-bank funding. A higher dependence on non-bank funding correlates with a greater likelihood of firms drawing on credit lines during widespread financial distress. This results in these firms having reduced access to bank-provided credit lines, affecting both their availability (extensive margin) and terms (intensive margin). Consequently, these companies tend to rely
more on cash than credit lines for managing liquidity. We exploit the oil price shock of 2014-16 and the subsequent drop in leveraged loan purchases by affected lenders as a plausibly exogenous supply-side shock to corporate reliance on non-banks. Firms facing immediate risks of refinancing their leveraged loans tend to reduce their debt. However, for those not under immediate refinancing pressure, the anticipation of decreased dependence on leveraged loans leads to improved access to bank credit lines later on, often with lower fees. This enhances their liquidity management and capital growth."
